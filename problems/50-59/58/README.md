# Spiral primes
## [Problem 58](https://projecteuler.net/problem=58)

Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

<pre>
<b>37</b> 36 35 34 33 32 <b>31</b>
38 <b>17</b> 16 15 14 <b>13</b> 30
39 18  <b>5</b>  4  <b>3</b> 12 29
40 19  6  1  2 11 28
41 20  <b>7</b>  8  9 10 27
42 21 22 23 24 25 26
<b>43</b> 44 45 46 47 48 49
</pre>

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
