# What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

# My Solutions
I originally discovered project euler when I was a junior in high school. I was fascinated by the problems and quickly began spending several hours a week working on them in my free time. At the time the only language I knew was Visual Basic so I completed the first 20 or so problems in VB. Once I learned C as freshman in college, I switched to C and when necessary C++.

All of my posted solutions are correct (the website allows you to check your answer) and I have never cheated or received help on the problems, although there are certainly a plethora of solutions on the internet for those who struggle with them. I am currently in the process of resolving the problems that I had previously done in VB as I don't think the VB solutions are worth sharing (yay highschool code!) so that explains some of the gaps.

All solutions can be compiled with gcc/g++ and some require the -lm flag for the math library. Some solutions also have a corresponding ".in" file that should be piped into the executable when run. All input is read from stdin and the output is a single line to stdout.
