# What is Project Euler?
> [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

# My Solutions
I discovered project euler when I was a junior in high school. I was fascinated by the problems and spent quite a bit of time solving as many as I could. I completed the first 25 problems in Visual Basic, my primary language at the time. Once I learned C during my freshman year in college I quickly switched and rewrote the earlier problems. After college I fell in love with Python and it's my language of choice for solving new problems. Perhaps I'll upload my old VB solutions at some point for the laughs.
